# MultiCaret

Multi-Caret is a plugin I wrote for Visual Studio. It adds multi-point editing features as found in [Sublime Text](https://sublimetext.com) and a few other editors. I wrote an introductory post [here](http://gwerren.com/Blog/Posts/introducingMultiCaret).

**Note:** This plugin works well on it's own but has a few interaction issues when used with ReSharper.

You are welcome to use it in any way you wish. I have not uploaded a compiled version to the Visual Studio marketplace since I do not feel the plugin in it's current state will be of significant use to many people given the recent inclusion of some of this functionality in the latest Visual Studio 2017 versions.
